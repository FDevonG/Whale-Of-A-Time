The hosts are so accommodating, driving us around the campground to check for the perfect site and road conditions. Sure had the perfect site. We didn't see any whales but heard them blowing - they definitely are there. Ask Gail to show you a photo of one breaching - we missed it because we were in a pay whale boat at the time. Can't wait to return. We hope Gail, Reid, Oliver, Seven and Six(?) all the best. I'm sure it will be a smashing success.", 5),
